# China
Maven project start

Instruction:

-Maven can help

-Run ServerExec.java in package Server

-Choose options. Don't spoil the party here, I didn't want to do "IF statment's forest"

-Run for ClientExec in package Client. In normal game or with recording run in parallel for each player

-If you try watch game one run is enough. In DB you have games with id 1, 2 to start with

-If you don't want to use tests, it's better to uncomment code in ServerHead to auto-stop server when any player leaving
