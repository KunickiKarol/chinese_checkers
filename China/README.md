Instruction:

-Load database from .sql backup

-Source is directory "China". Maven should help

-Run ServerExec.java in package Server

-Choose options. Don't spoil the party here, I didn't want to do "IF statment's forest"

-Run ClientExec.java in package Client. In normal game or with recording run in parallel for each player

-One run is enough, if you try watch game In DB you have games with id 1, 2 to start with

-If you don't want to use tests, it's better to uncomment code in ServerHead stop function to auto-stop server when somebody leave
